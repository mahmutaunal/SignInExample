# Sign In Example

This is the source code for a simple web application where the user can enter their first name, last name, and username. As the user fills out all three fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the sign-in area. When all three fields are filled in, the progress bar turns green, spanning the full width of the sign-in area, and the "Sign up" button becomes enabled. Clicking the "Sign up" button causes a welcome screen to animate in from the bottom of the screen.
